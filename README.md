#  **Experiment 4.	(a) Experimental determination of the frequency response of Series Resonant RLC Circuits. **

##  *Aim*
To experimentally verify the *frequency response* of an R–L–C series circuit.

---

##  *Procedure*

1. Make the circuit connections:  
   (1–3), (4–5), (8–6), (6–10), (9–11), (2–7), (7–9).  
2. Apply *3 V (peak-to-peak)* sinusoidal input.  
   Set: *R = 200 Ω, **L = 0.1 H, **C = 0.1 µF*.  
3. Turn ON oscilloscope → Select *Sine wave* → Click *Output*.  
4. Vary input frequency from *100 Hz to 5000 Hz* and observe output.  
5. If waveform exceeds screen → increase *Volt/Div*.  
6. If signal becomes a line → reduce *Time/Div* to *0.2 ms*.  
7. Switch off oscilloscope.  
8. Click *TableShow* to store readings.  
9. Click *GainPlot* for Gain vs Frequency and *PhasePlot* for phase angle.  
10. Increase *R* to modify damping ratio: ζ = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7.  
11. Observe *maximum gain* and *–3 dB cutoff frequency*.
